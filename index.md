## Course description
Blockchain has the potential to transform many segments of the industry and society. In this course, we plan to cover advanced topics on blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptoeconomics. We will discuss recent research papers and techniques on scalability, privacy, different consensus mechanisms, attacks on blockchain and smart contracts and mitigation against them, applications of blockchain and smart contracts, and cryptoeconomics. 

The course is 3-units, and will consist of several research paper readings per week, in-class discussions of the papers, and a large course project per project group.

## Class format and project
This is a project oriented class. Each lecture will focus on one of the research topics on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Each week, students are expected to complete reading assignments before class and participate actively in class discussion.

Students will also form project groups and complete a high-impact research project. The final project/deliverable will be a team presentation and a paper/report on the project.

## Grading

<ul>
  <li>20% class participation</li>
  <li>20% weekly reading assignment</li>
  <li>60% project</li>
</ul>
